This is the final version of the html structure code of the sixth "Probleamtica Semanal" from the Become a Quality Assurance course. 
In this code i took a newspapper web page, found a news and try myself to recreate the structure of that web page with the basics html structures i learned this week.
The important things in wich i put effort and ephasis was the accurate search of a news that contains a lot of the elements learned this week (paragraphs, links, tables, list etc) the proxility of the code and the correct use of semantics.
